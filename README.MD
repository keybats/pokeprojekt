# Pokeprojekt

Simulates pokemon fights.

Currently the game will spawn a random pokemon for you and your opponent on clicking the start button.
Clicking one of the moves will start the combat round and your pokemon will use the selected move while your opponent will use one of their moves at random. Everything that happens is then written in the combat log.

The pokemon only have the base stats and types associated with the pokemon, their moves are randomly selected from a small list.

### Known bugs:
Attack buttons occasionally show the wrong attack name
Exp will sometimes be awarded to the wrong pokemon
